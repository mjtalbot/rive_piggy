# rive_piggy

This is a sample Rive app for Android. 

The simple to use [RiveAnimationView](https://github.com/rive-app/rive-android/blob/master/kotlin/src/main/java/app/rive/runtime/kotlin/RiveAnimationView.kt) allows you to play animations or state machines in a couple of lines of code. This is great to get started with and check out the [help center](https://help.rive.app/runtimes/quick-start). 

The animation view is great for simple use cases, but in this example we want to shows how to use the [core](https://github.com/rive-app/rive-android/tree/master/kotlin/src/main/java/app/rive/runtime/kotlin/core) parts of the animation library to make a custom animation loop with far more control!

# Piggy.riv file set up. 

The piggy .riv file is split into 3 artboards
